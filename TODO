-- preprocessing
	-- use RGB lookup table for selecting colors instead of algorithm
	-- dithering
	-- sort drl segments by total color distance rather than length of run
	-- select proper aspect ratio
	-- insert 'whole' frames periodically in stream
	-- brightness/contrast
	-- scoring based strictly on size of input + output bitstreams
	-- use fewer tmp files (i.e. more piping) to improve conversion time

-- transition to single integrate utility for generating movie from
   ppm/pcm data
